# # Lesson 6 - 2-dimensional list

# ## Recap 1: List of 100 unique numbers
# **Recap 1a**:
# You are preparing for an upcoming lucky draw session at your
# school. However, there must be no repeating winning numbers.
# Task: Create a program to create 100 random unique numbers in
# a list
# 1. Use a loop to add 100 random numbers into your list.
# 2. Each number added range between 1 to 1000
# 3. Ensure that all the numbers are unique

# import random
# numberlist=[]
# number=random.randint(1,101)
# while True:
#     if number not in numberlist:
#         numberlist.append(number)
#     if len(numberlist) == 100:
#         break
# print(numberlist)

# **Recap 1b**:
# You have been asked to provide some statistics based on the
# list of numbers generated.

# 1. Using max(), find the highest number from the list
# 2. Using min(), find the lowest number from the list
# 3. Using sum() and len(), find the average from the list
# 4. By importing the 'random' library and using random.choice(),
#    print out a random number from the list.
# 5. Using index(), print out the index of the printed random
#    number.


## Task 1: A list within a list 

# You are about to graduate and would like to create a database
# to keep all your friend's contact details using a 2d list.

# Sample Code (Copy + Paste the below code):
# contacts = []
# contact1 = ["John", 98453126, "john@gmail.com"]
# contact2 = ["Adam", 93029102, "adam@gmail.com"]
# contact3 = ["Sylvia", 87894032, "sylvia@gmail.com"]

# 1. append contact1, contact2, and contact3 into contacts
# 2. Write a nested loop to loop through each contact and print
#    the details for each contact

# contacts = []
# contact1 = ["John", 98453126, "john@gmail.com"]
# contact2 = ["Adam", 93029102, "adam@gmail.com"]
# contact3 = ["Sylvia", 87894032, "sylvia@gmail.com"]

# contacts.append(contact1)
# contacts.append(contact2)
# contacts.append(contact3)
# for person in contacts:
#     for item in person:
#         print(item)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Student List
# You have been given a 2d list of students from a class
# consisting each student's name and their gender:

# Sample Code (Copy + Paste the below code):
# students = [
#     ["Olivia", "F"], ["Noah", "M"], ["Emma", "F"],
#     ["Liam", "M"], ["Ava", "F"], ["Ethan", "M"],
#     ["Sophia", "F"], ["Lucas", "M"], ["Mia", "F"],
#     ["Aiden", "M"], ["Isabella", "F"], ["Jackson", "M"],
#     ["Amelia", "F"], ["Logan", "M"], ["Lily", "F"]
# ]
# # ### the above is a nested list. Study and discuss it before we
# ### move on.

# 1. Write a for loop to print out the names of each student and
#    the gender beside.
   
#    e.g. Olivia F
#         Noah M

# students = [
# ["Olivia", "F"], ["Noah", "M"], ["Emma", "F"],
# ["Liam", "M"], ["Ava", "F"], ["Ethan", "M"],
# ["Sophia", "F"], ["Lucas", "M"], ["Mia", "F"],
# ["Aiden", "M"], ["Isabella", "F"], ["Jackson", "M"],
# ["Amelia", "F"], ["Logan", "M"], ["Lily", "F"]
# ]
# for student in students:
#     name,gender=student
#     print(name,"is a",gender)
## Task 3: Boys and Girls
# Based on the class list given in the previous task, separate
# the class into 2 lists of boys and girls.

# 1. Create 2 more lists called boys and girls.
# 2. Loop through the 'students' list from the previous task
#    a. if the gender is a boy, add the name into the boys list
#    b. if the gender is a girl, add the name into the girls list
# 3. Write a for loop and name all the boys
# 4. Write a for loop and name all the girls
# 5. Print out how many boys and girls there are

# students = [
# ["Olivia", "F"], ["Noah", "M"], ["Emma", "F"],
# ["Liam", "M"], ["Ava", "F"], ["Ethan", "M"],
# ["Sophia", "F"], ["Lucas", "M"], ["Mia", "F"],
# ["Aiden", "M"], ["Isabella", "F"], ["Jackson", "M"],
# ["Amelia", "F"], ["Logan", "M"], ["Lily", "F"]
# ]

# boys=[]
# girls=[]

# for student in students:
#     if student == "F":
#         girls.append(student)
#     else:
#         boys.append(student)

# for girl in girls:
#     print(girl)
# for boy in boys:
#     print(boy)

# print(len(girls))
# print(len(boys))

a1 = [
    [1 , 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8 ,9]
]

a2 = [
    [7 , 9, 3],
    [7, 5, 4],
    [1, 8 ,4]
]

a3 = []
for i in range(len(a1)):
    
# find a3 if i want to add for example [1,2,3] and [7,9,3] = [1+7, 2+9, 3+3]
# i want you to add each element at the respective to one another for a1 and a2
