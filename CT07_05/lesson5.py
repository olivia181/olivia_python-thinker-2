# Lesson 5 - List Variables II

# ## Recap 1: Favourite Food List
# **Recap 1a**:
# Create a list of 5 food that you like to eat
# food_list=["sushi","chicken rice","fried rice","salmon with rice","egg"]

# **Recap 1b**:
# You no longer like to eat the 3rd item on your list,
# delete it
# food_list.pop(2)
# print(food_list)
# **Recap 1c**:
# Add 1 more item into your list
# food_list.append("ramen")

# **Recap 1d**:
# Write a for loop to say all the food items in your list
# for i in range(len(food_list)):
#     print(food_list[i])

## Task 1: List of 100 numbers 
# You are preparing for an upcoming lucky draw session at your
# school. You have been tasked to create a program that will pick
# 100 lucky winners.

# By importing the 'random' library and using 'random.randint()',
# create a program to create 100 random numbers in a list
# 1. Use a loop to add 100 random numbers into your list.
# 2. Each number added range between 1 to 1000

## Task 2: List of 100 unique numbers
# The program you have created from the previous task will
# sometimes generate duplicate numbers. Modify your program so
# that the 100 numbers generated are all unique.

# Modify your program from the previous task to create 100 random
# unique numbers in a list.
# 1. Use a loop to add 100 random numbers into your list.
# 2. Each number added range between 1 to 1000
# 3. Ensure that all the numbers are unique
# 4. Print the list of 100 unique numbers created

# Hint: Use a while loop to check if the number already exists in
# the loop
# num_list=[]
# import random
# while True:
#     number=random.randint(1,100)
#     if number not in num_list:
#         num_list.append(number)
#     if len(num_list) == 100:
#         break
# print(num_list)
# print(len(num_list))

## Task 3: Score Taker
# Imagine the list that you have created in Task 2 represent the
# score of a 100 students.

# Find the maximum, minimum and average from the list.

# 1. Using the 'max()' function, find the maximum score.
# 2. Using the 'min()' function, find the minimum score.
# 3. Using the 'sum()' and 'len()' function, calculate the
#    average score.

# score = [75, 87, 72, 72, 71, 92, 65, 80, 83, 76, 68, 96, 77, 100, 98, 69, 67, 74, 87, 89, 72, 88, 66, 71, 94, 70, 73, 90, 96, 72, 96, 95, 70, 100, 98, 97, 91, 69, 83, 92, 81, 94, 75, 83, 85, 93, 77, 72, 89, 82, 99, 78, 83, 69, 94, 98, 84, 74, 68, 96, 100, 82, 82, 93, 66, 98, 65, 70, 93, 96, 87, 68, 78, 92, 99, 68, 66, 71, 91, 83, 99, 75, 70, 92, 84, 75, 97, 84, 67, 84, 78, 86, 79, 69, 94, 69, 98, 73, 100, 79]
# best_score= max(score)
# print(best_score)
# worst_score= min(score)
# print(worst_score)
# average_score=sum(score)/len(score)
# print(average_score)

# Task: You are given 2 lists, 
# **namelist** contains a list of students in your class
# **heightlist** contains a list of the corresponding student's
#                height

# 1. Determine who is the tallest in class, and what is his/ her
#    name
# 2. Determine who is the shortest in class, and what is his/ her
#    name


# namelist = ["Olivia", "Liam", "Emma", "Noah", "Ava", "Ethan",
# "Sophia", "Lucas", "Mia", "Aiden"]

# heightlist = [160, 165, 158, 170, 162, 168, 159, 172, 164, 166]

# tallest_height= max(heightlist)
# tallest_height_index=heightlist.index(tallest_height)
# print(namelist[tallest_height_index])

# shortest_height= min(heightlist)
# shortest_height_index=heightlist.index(shortest_height)
# print(namelist[shortest_height_index])

## Task 5: Pokemon, I choose you!
# Task: You are given 2 lists,
# **pokemons** contains a list of pokemons
# **powers** contains a list of the corresponding pokemon's
#            powers

# 1. Choose 2 random pokemons from the list
# 2. Compare the powers of the 2 pokemons
# 3. Calculate who is the winner of the fight between these 2
#    pokemons
#    (pokemon with the higher power will always win)
import random

pokemons = ["Pikachu", "Charizard", "Bulbasaur", "Squirtle",
"Jigglypuff", "Meowth", "Psyduck", "Eevee", "Snorlax",
"Mewtwo", "Lapras", "Gengar", "Dragonite", "Machamp",
"Arcanine", "Alakazam", "Gyarados", "Vaporeon", "Scyther","Electabuzz"]

powers = [55, 84, 49, 48, 45,45, 52, 55, 110, 110,85, 65, 134, 130, 110,
50, 125, 65, 110, 83]


# Hint: import the random library and use random.choice(listname)
